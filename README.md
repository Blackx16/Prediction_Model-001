# Data Prediction Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different prediction tasks using machine learning models.

## Notebooks

### 1. Predict Amount

- **File**: `Predict_amount.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook focuses on predicting a numerical value, such as sales amounts, prices, or any other continuous variable. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data Loading: Importing the dataset.
  - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data types.
  - EDA: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.
  - Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
  - Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms.
  - Model Training: Training the model on the dataset.
  - Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

### 2. Vaccination Prediction

- **File**: `Vaccination_prediction.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook focuses on predicting vaccination rates or the likelihood of individuals getting vaccinated. It involves similar steps as the first notebook but with a focus on classification tasks.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data Loading: Importing the dataset.
  - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data types.
  - EDA: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.
  - Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
  - Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms.
  - Model Training: Training the model on the dataset.
  - Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

## Requirements
